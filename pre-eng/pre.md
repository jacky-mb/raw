I don’t raising animals and dogs , with me dogs is a normal entity in the worlds and universe.

## Reality:

At the moment, we have many time case dogs attach people , that special is adults and children , victim so wear and
slowly

## Risk

`Sickness` : Rabies is contagious from tap a dog - a reason people to die

`Environment` : we can't make control dogs waste in public area

`Noise pollution` : barking dogs make uncomfortable to neighbourhood or this your family
